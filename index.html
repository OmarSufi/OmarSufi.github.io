        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After graduating college, I became a Dental Assistant. It was very rewarding being an assistant and I enjoyed many things about it.<br>
        As the years went by, I started to grow fond of programs and programming. I would watch YouTube videos and play around with coding <br>
    programs. </p>
        <p>I'm currently a student at Thinkful and began my journey to become a software developer.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, you will find me in either the gym playing basketball or your nearest Old Chicago Pizzaria</p>
